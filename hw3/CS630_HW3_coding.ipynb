    "# Triangle counting\n",
    "\n",
    "A triangle is a graph structure with three-node all connecting to each other. Finding triangles in real world networks is important due to the homogenous meaning it carries. For example, in a facebook network where nodes represent users and edges represent \"friend\" relations, users connected by triangle structures are more likely to know each other in real life. However, counting triangles can be a computation-heavy task on large graphs, i.e., the best known deterministic algorithm has a complexity of $O(m^{3/2})$. In this homework, we will study a randomized approach that significantly accerlerate the computation, proposed in [1].\n",

    "$G(n, p)$ is a simple random graph model of the Erdős-Rényi graphs. It generates graphs with $n$ nodes by independently sample the existance of each possible edge by probability $p$. Networkx provides a convenient way to generate random graphs using built-in functions for various commonly used graph models. To create an Erdős-Rényi graph, we can use the function nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n, p), where n is the number of nodes and p is the probability of an edge between two nodes. The function returns an nx.Graph object containing the nodes and edges of the generated graph."
